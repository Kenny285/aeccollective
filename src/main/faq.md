## General

1. What's a typical day in your job as an architect/engineer/contractor?

-Architect

Link to Jacob's appearance on stemomfire podcast

-Engineer

I don't think I have a real typical day. Today was a 6:30am-5pm day. Routine safety inspection in the morning. Coordinated amongst electrician, protection carpenters and demo contractor to demo an opening in existing building. Reviewed layout of swimming pool with pool contractor. Coordinated logistics for carpenter for future work. Inspected drilling for dowels for concrete slab. Progress/manpower reports. Obtained quotes from vendors for certain supplies. 
-Kenny (construction superintendent)

2. Who does what?

## Architecture
1. What is the difference between architecture and architectural engineering?

Architecture is about the design of overall buildings, while architectural engineering is concerned with the systems that make buildings function. This includes HVAC, plumbing, sprinklers, etc.

2. Do architects only concern themselves with aesthetics?
There's a popular misconception that architects only care about making buildings look nice, but they do so much more. Here are some of their responsibilities:
- Coordination with other design consultants (MEPS Engineer, Structural Engineer, Geotechnical Engineer, Elevator Consultant, Lighting Consultant, etc)
- ADA Accessibility compliance
- Functionality of spaces
- Life safety and egress

## Engineering
1. What are some tips for studying for the Fundamentals of Engineering Exam?

## Construction
1. I'm currently in college and want to work in construction management afterwards. Should I study civil engineering or construction management?

Civil engineering programs are more technical and are rooted in math & science. If you can handle material like this, it's typically better to study civil engineering rather than construction management; it gives you more flexibility at graduation with jobs and companies. Construction management firms will hire civil engineering majors, but not vice versa.

2. I'm about to graduate and am looking for a job where I can design and do engineering. Is construction management right for me?

No. There is little to no design in construction management. That is not to be confused with construction engineering though, which does involve the engineering of temporary structures.
