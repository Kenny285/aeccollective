## Architecture
1. What is the difference between architecture and architectural engineering?

Architecture is about the design of overall buildings, while architectural engineering is concerned with the systems that make buildings function. This includes HVAC, plumbing, sprinklers, etc.

2. Do architects only concern themselves with aesthetics?
There's a popular misconception that architects only care about making buildings look nice, but they do so much more. Here are some of their responsibilities:

- ADA Accessibility compliance
- Functionality of spaces
